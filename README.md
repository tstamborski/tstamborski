Hello! 👋

Here you find a few of my hobby projects. If you want to somehow support my work - I don't need your money, but
if you could **give a star to one of my projects** to others can find it more easily, it will always be appreciated.
Other kinds of sharing or advertising my programs are very appreciated too, but just remember that some of them are
unfinished and/or generally not ready to meet a wider audience.
