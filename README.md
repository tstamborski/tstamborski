# ![](avatar128.png) Hi there 👋

I’m Tobiasz Stamborski.  
I write code for fun and curiosity. My projects may be small, but they are created with passion and learning in mind.  

## 🔧 What I Like to Build
- Small tools that make everyday life easier  
- Fun experiments with code  
- Learning projects where I try new technologies  

## 🌟 Some Projects
- [Sprite Studio 64](https://github.com/tstamborski/sprite-studio-64) – A native sprite editor for Commodore 64 in cyberpunk style.  
- [Master of Sprites](https://github.com/tstamborski/master-of-sprites) - Yet another sprite editor for Commodore 64. This time written in java and worth to try as an alternative to SpritePad.
- [Happy Coloring Book](https://github.com/tstamborski/happy-coloring-book) - A toy application for coloring images.
- [Pixelart Icons](https://github.com/tstamborski/pixelart-icons) – A set of my hand-drawn icons.  

## 🌱 About Me
- Amateur programmer, always learning  
- Coding is my way of having fun and staying curious  
- I hope my projects can inspire or help someone out there
