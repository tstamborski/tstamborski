# ![](avatar128.png) Hi there 👋

I’m Tobiasz Stamborski. 👋  
I write code for fun and curiosity. My projects may be small, but they are created with passion and learning in mind.  

## 🔧 What I Like to Build
- Small tools that make everyday life easier  
- Fun experiments with code  
- Learning projects where I try new technologies  

## 🌟 My Most Valuable Projects
- [Sprite Studio 64](https://github.com/tstamborski/sprite-studio-64) – A native sprite editor for Commodore 64 in cyberpunk style.  
- [Master of Sprites](https://github.com/tstamborski/master-of-sprites) - Yet another sprite editor for Commodore 64. This time written in Java and worth to try as an alternative to SpritePad.
- [Happy Coloring Book](https://github.com/tstamborski/happy-coloring-book) - A toy application for coloring images.
- [Pixelart Icons](https://github.com/tstamborski/pixelart-icons) – A set of my hand-drawn icons.  

## 🧑‍💻 What Technologies I Use
- **Java** - currently my most used language.
- **C/C++** - long time when I switched to Java but I still remember and think about going back to them.
- **x86 and MOS6502 assembly** - programming in assembly is good for the soul of programmer. 😁
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** - honestly I ain't the best web designer but I use sometimes for minor tasks.
- **Ant** - I think it's still good for small Java projects.
- **Maven** - I learn and use, because it can automatically handle dependencies and several different types of packaging.
- **Bash** - Linux shell which I use also on Windows to automate some tasks.

## 🧑‍🎓 What I am Learning
- **Data structures and algorithms** - I already know the basics (big O notation, space and time complexity of algorithm, differences between ArrayList and LinkedList) but still a lot of learning too.
- **SOLID principles and design patterns in Java** - I make progress from one project to next, but according to ChatGPT reviews my code still has a lot of drawbacks (I know).
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** - still learning and I hope to create some really stunning home page one day.
- **Maven** - I have started to use it and I learn some `pom.xml` complexities everyday. 🙂
- **SQL** - I know the CRUD basics and I am going to learn more.
- **ARM assembly language** - I think about writtening a simple operating system for Raspberry Pi but this will probably wait.

## 🌱 About Me
- Amateur programmer, always learning  
- Coding is my way of having fun and staying curious  
- I hope my projects can inspire or help someone out there
