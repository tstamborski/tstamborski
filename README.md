Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Here you can find a few of my hobby projects. If you want to somehow support my work - I don't need your money, but
if you could **give a star to one of my projects** to others can find it more easily, it will always be appreciated.
Other kinds of sharing or advertising my programs are very appreciated too, but just remember that some of them are
unfinished and/or generally not ready to meet a wider audience.

If you want to ask any question, feel free to send an e-mail to me: **tstamborski@outlook.com**.
I don't promise I will always answer but honestly I'm even happy if somebody asking something and probably I will
answer even soon. So don't hestitate too long if you want something. ðŸ™‚

BTW: I have here at least two or three repos, that I planned to develop futher (even written in their readme.md my plans
for the future), but honestly i have abondoned them long time ago and maybe I will return to them someday or maybe not.

Best Regards,

Tobiasz Stamborski
