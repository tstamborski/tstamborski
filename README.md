# ![](avatar128.png) Hi there 👋

I’m Tobiasz Stamborski. 👋  
I write code for fun and curiosity. My projects may be small, but they are created with passion and learning in mind.  

## 🔧 What I Like to Build
- Small tools that make everyday life easier  
- Fun experiments with code  
- Learning projects where I try new technologies  

## 🌟 My Most Valuable Projects
- [**Sprite Studio 64**](https://github.com/tstamborski/sprite-studio-64) – A native sprite editor for Commodore 64 in cyberpunk style  
- [**Master of Sprites**](https://github.com/tstamborski/master-of-sprites) - Yet another sprite editor for Commodore 64 - this time written in Java and worth to try as an alternative to SpritePad
- [**Happy Coloring Book**](https://github.com/tstamborski/happy-coloring-book) - A toy application for coloring images
- [**Pixelart Icons**](https://github.com/tstamborski/pixelart-icons) – A set of my hand-drawn icons  

## 🧑‍💻 What Technologies I Use
- **Java** - Currently my most used language
- **C/C++** - I used them in the past; I still remember them and sometimes think of returning
- **x86 and MOS6502 assembly** - I believe programming in assembly builds a deeper understanding of how computers work
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** - I'm not the best web designer, but I sometimes use HTML/CSS/JavaScript for small tasks
- **Ant** - I still find it useful for small Java projects
- **Maven** - I’m learning and using Maven; it helps manage dependencies and supports different packaging types
- **Bash** - Bash — I use it (even on Windows) for scripting and automating tasks

## 🧑‍🎓 What I am Learning
- **Data structures and algorithms** - I already know the basics (big O notation, space and time complexity of algorithm, differences between ArrayList and LinkedList), but there’s still so much to learn
- **SOLID principles and design patterns in Java** - I try to improve project by project; I know my code still has many issues, but I’m working on it
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** - Still learning and I hope to build a really beautiful homepage someday
- **Maven** - I have started to use and I learn some `pom.xml` complexities everyday ☺️
- **SQL** - I know CRUD and I want to learn more
- **ARM assembly** - I daydream about writing a simple OS for Raspberry Pi someday, but that’s for the future

## 🌱 About Me
- Amateur programmer, always learning  
- Coding is my way of having fun and staying curious  
- I hope my projects can inspire or help someone out there
